# MoneyBot

MoneyBot is a simple Python-based personal finance tool that helps users analyze their monthly budget. 

The user enters their monthly income and expenses, and the program generates an economic report showing total income, total expenses, balance, and a prediction for the next month. Based on the results, MoneyBot provides helpful comments and feedback. 

All reports can be saved and viewed later, allowing the user to track their financial situation over time.
